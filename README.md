# MST

## requires
[pyregion](https://pypi.org/project/pyregion/)
## Usage
* Untar *MST.tar.gz* and enter the folder *MST*.
* Run *MST.py* to get velocity coherent manimum spanning trees. A demo figure that shows the MSTs is generated in the folder *fig*.
* Run analysis.py to select large-scale filaments and do the following analysis. Physical properties of filaments are generated in *tab/t1a*. The distributions of physical properties and comparison to spiral arms are in *fig*.
## Others
This code is specified in ATLASGAL clumps (Urquhart et al. 2014, 2018). It employ Herschel Hi-GAL column density map from PPMAP (Marsh et al. 2017) for mass calculation. The spiral arm reference is Reid et al. 2019. If other data sets are used, the file input part of the code need to be revised.
